River Trail interactive shell
=============================

An interactive shell in your browser for writing and running River Trail programs. A live version is [here] (http://intellabs.github.io/RiverTrail-interactive/). If you have installed the [River Trail browser extension for Firefox](https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/wiki#getting-river-trail), your code will run in parallel. If you have not installed the Firefox extension, or if you are using a browser other than Firefox, your code will run sequentially.
